        Designing a Dynamic Pricing Engine for E-Commerce: Revenue Optimization and Machine Learning Applications
      </div>
      <p class="research-desc">
        This research explores the implementation of a dynamic pricing system similar to those used by Amazon, Uber, and major airlines. It combines regression, reinforcement learning, and API-based deployment to optimize pricing and revenue. Using real-world e-commerce datasets, the paper demonstrates modeling market dynamics, predicting demand, and simulating pricing strategies for thousands of products.
