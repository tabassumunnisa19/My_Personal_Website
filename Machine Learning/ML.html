<!-- ===================== 1. WHAT IS ML ===================== -->
<div class="topic-block">
<button class="topic-btn">
1. What is Machine Learning?
<i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
</button>
<div class="topic-content">

<p><strong>Machine Learning (ML)</strong> is a technique that enables computers to learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for every rule.</p>

<p>Instead of writing step-by-step instructions such as “if this happens, do that”, we provide the computer with historical data and the correct outcomes. The system then learns relationships from this data and improves its performance over time.</p>

<p>For a machine, learning does not mean thinking or understanding like humans. Learning means identifying mathematical patterns, correlations, and relationships between inputs and outputs.</p>

<p><strong>Human analogy:</strong> Just like a person learns to estimate travel time after making many trips, a machine learns from repeated exposure to data.</p>

<p><strong>Practical example:</strong> In email spam detection, the system learns from thousands of emails and identifies patterns such as keywords, sender behavior, and frequency — without any hard-coded rules.</p>

</div>
</div>

<!-- ===================== 2. TRADITIONAL VS ML ===================== -->
<div class="topic-block">
<button class="topic-btn">
2. Traditional Programming vs Machine Learning
<i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
</button>
<div class="topic-content">

<p>Traditional programming follows a rule-based approach. The programmer explicitly writes logic, and the computer simply executes those instructions.</p>

<p><strong>Traditional programming flow:</strong></p>
<p><code>Rules + Data → Output</code></p>

<p>This approach works well only when rules are simple, fixed, and clearly known.</p>

<p><strong>Machine Learning follows a different approach:</strong></p>
<p><code>Data + Output → Model (Rules)</code></p>

<p>Instead of writing rules, the machine discovers them automatically from data. This makes Machine Learning suitable for complex, real-world problems where rules are unclear or constantly changing.</p>

<p><strong>Key idea:</strong> ML is used when humans cannot clearly explain the rules.</p>

</div>
</div>

<!-- ===================== 3. WHY ML ===================== -->
<div class="topic-block">
<button class="topic-btn">
3. Why Machine Learning?
<i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
</button>
<div class="topic-content">

<p>Machine Learning is required because modern problems involve massive data, complex relationships, and continuously changing conditions.</p>

<p><strong>1. Explosion of data:</strong> Climate sensors, financial systems, medical devices, and online platforms generate enormous amounts of data every day. Humans cannot analyze this manually.</p>

<p><strong>2. Complex relationships:</strong> Real-world outcomes depend on many interacting variables. For example, disasters are influenced by temperature, humidity, ocean cycles, and urbanization.</p>

<p><strong>3. Dynamic systems:</strong> Rules that work today may fail tomorrow. Machine Learning adapts automatically by learning from new data.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> ML is essential because the world is data-rich, complex, and constantly evolving.</p>

4. Applications of Machine Learning
<i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
</button>
<div class="topic-content">

<p><strong>Weather & Climate:</strong> ML helps analyze long-term climate data, detect anomalies, and forecast extreme events.</p>

<p><strong>Healthcare:</strong> ML assists in disease prediction, medical image analysis, and patient risk assessment. It supports doctors but does not replace them.</p>

<p><strong>Finance:</strong> Used for fraud detection, credit scoring, and market analysis. Fraud patterns change frequently, making ML ideal.</p>

<p><strong>Recommendation systems:</strong> Platforms like Netflix and YouTube learn user preferences from behavior rather than fixed rules.</p>

<p><strong>Climate & disaster analysis:</strong> ML can identify extreme climate years, cluster ENSO patterns, and predict disaster likelihood.</p>

  <button class="topic-btn">
    Why Do We Classify Machine Learning into Types?
    <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
  </button>
  <div class="topic-content">

    <p>Before learning Machine Learning algorithms, it is extremely important to understand what kind of learning problem we are trying to solve.</p>

    <p>Not all problems are the same. Different problems require different kinds of data, different learning strategies, and different algorithms.</p>

    <p>Machine Learning is therefore classified based on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>How data is provided to the model</li>
      <li>Whether correct answers (labels) are available or not</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This classification helps us decide which approach and algorithms are suitable for a given real-world problem.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<!-- ===================== MAIN TYPES ===================== -->
<div class="topic-block">
  <button class="topic-btn">
    Main Types of Machine Learning
    <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
  </button>
  <div class="topic-content">

    <p>Based on how learning happens, Machine Learning is broadly divided into four main types:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Supervised Learning</li>
      <li>Unsupervised Learning</li>
      <li>Semi-Supervised Learning</li>
      <li>Reinforcement Learning</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Each type addresses a different learning scenario and is used for different categories of problems.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<!-- ===================== SUPERVISED LEARNING ===================== -->
<div class="topic-block">
  <button class="topic-btn">
    1. Supervised Learning
    <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
  </button>
  <div class="topic-content">

    <p>In <strong>Supervised Learning</strong>, the machine learns from <strong>labeled data</strong>.</p>

    <p>This means that for every input data point, the correct output is already known. The model learns by comparing its predicted output with the actual correct output.</p>

    <p>The learning process happens under supervision, similar to how a student learns with the guidance of a teacher.</p>

    <p><strong>Example of labeled data:</strong></p>

    <p>Temperature, Humidity → Rain (Yes / No)</p>

    <p>During training, the model repeatedly adjusts itself to reduce the error between its predictions and the correct answers.</p>

    <p>Supervised learning is the most widely used type of Machine Learning in data science and real-world applications.</p>

</div>

<!-- ===================== REGRESSION ===================== -->
<div class="topic-block">
  <button class="topic-btn">
    Supervised Learning — Regression
    <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
  </button>
  <div class="topic-content">

    <p><strong>Regression</strong> is a type of supervised learning used when the output variable is a <strong>continuous numerical value</strong>.</p>

    <p>In regression problems, the goal is to predict a quantity.</p>

    <p><strong>Examples of regression problems:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Predicting temperature</li>
      <li>Predicting rainfall amount</li>
      <li>Predicting house prices</li>
      <li>Predicting CO₂ emission levels</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Regression problems answer questions such as <em>“How much?”</em> or <em>“How many?”</em>.</p>

    Supervised Learning — Classification
    <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
  </button>
  <div class="topic-content">

    <p><strong>Classification</strong> is a type of supervised learning used when the output is a <strong>category or class</strong>.</p>

    <p>The model learns to assign input data to one of the predefined classes.</p>

    <p><strong>Examples of classification problems:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Flood / No Flood</li>
      <li>El Niño / La Niña / Neutral</li>
      <li>Disease Yes / No</li>
      <li>Spam / Not Spam</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Classification problems answer questions such as <em>“Which category does this belong to?”</em>.</p>

<!-- ===================== UNSUPERVISED LEARNING ===================== -->
<div class="topic-block">
  <button class="topic-btn">
    2. Unsupervised Learning
    <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
  </button>
  <div class="topic-content">

    <p>In <strong>Unsupervised Learning</strong>, the machine learns from <strong>unlabeled data</strong>.</p>

    <p>This means that no correct output values are provided. The model must discover patterns and structure in the data on its own.</p>

    <p>Unsupervised learning is primarily used for <strong>exploration</strong> rather than direct prediction.</p>

    <p>The model tries to find similarities, differences, or unusual patterns in the data.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<!-- ===================== UNSUPERVISED TASKS ===================== -->
<div class="topic-block">
  <button class="topic-btn">
    Unsupervised Learning — Common Tasks
    <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>

    <p><strong>Clustering:</strong> Grouping similar data points together.</p>

    <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Grouping similar climate years</li>
      <li>Clustering disaster-prone regions</li>
      <li>Customer segmentation</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Unsupervised learning is useful when we do not know in advance what patterns exist in the data.</p>

<div class="topic-block">
  <button class="topic-btn">
    3. Semi-Supervised Learning
    <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
  </button>
  <div class="topic-content">

    <p><strong>Semi-Supervised Learning</strong> is a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning.</p>

    <p>In this approach, only a small portion of the data is labeled, while a large portion remains unlabeled.</p>

    <p>This situation is very common in real-world applications because labeling data is often expensive, time-consuming, and requires domain expertise.</p>

    <p>Semi-supervised learning helps improve model performance by making effective use of unlabeled data.</p>

    4. Reinforcement Learning
    <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
  </button>
  <div class="topic-content">

    <p><strong>Reinforcement Learning</strong> is a type of learning based on <strong>trial and error</strong>.</p>

    <p>The model, called an <strong>agent</strong>, interacts with an environment by taking actions.</p>

    <p>For each action, the agent receives feedback in the form of a <strong>reward</strong> or a <strong>penalty</strong>.</p>

    <p>The goal of reinforcement learning is to learn a strategy that maximizes the total reward over time.</p>

    <p>This type of learning is inspired by how humans and animals learn from experience.</p>

    Why Do We Need a Machine Learning Workflow?
    <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
  </button>
  <div class="topic-content">

    <p>Machine Learning is not just about choosing an algorithm.</p>

    <p>Many beginners think, “If I learn algorithms, I know Machine Learning.” This assumption is incorrect.</p>

    <p>In real-world projects, algorithms are only a small part of the overall process. Most of the effort goes into understanding the problem and preparing the data.</p>

    <p>A Machine Learning workflow provides a systematic, step-by-step process to solve problems correctly and efficiently.</p>

    <p>Without a proper workflow, results become unreliable, models fail in real-world usage, and conclusions become misleading.</p>

    High-Level Overview of the Machine Learning Workflow
    <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
  </button>
  <div class="topic-content">

    <p>A typical Machine Learning workflow consists of the following stages:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Problem Understanding</li>
      <li>Data Collection</li>
      <li>Data Exploration (EDA)</li>
      <li>Data Preprocessing</li>
      <li>Feature Selection & Feature Engineering</li>
      <li>Model Selection & Training</li>
      <li>Model Evaluation</li>
      <li>Model Tuning & Improvement</li>
      <li>Deployment & Monitoring (conceptual)</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Each step is important and cannot be skipped.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<!-- ===================== STEP 1 ===================== -->
<div class="topic-block">
  <button class="topic-btn">
    1. Problem Understanding
    <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
  </button>
  <div class="topic-content">

    <p>Before touching any data, we must clearly understand what problem we are solving, why we are solving it, and how success will be measured.</p>

    <p>A poorly defined problem leads to wrong model choices, incorrect evaluation, and useless results.</p>

    <p>Important questions to ask include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Is this a prediction problem or a pattern discovery problem?</li>
      <li>Is the output numerical or categorical?</li>
      <li>Who will use the result?</li>
      <li>What decisions depend on this model?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For example, instead of saying “We want to analyze disasters,” a better problem statement is “We want to predict the likelihood of climate-related disasters based on temperature, ENSO index, and urbanization.”</p>

  </div>
</div>

<!-- ===================== STEP 2 ===================== -->
<div class="topic-block">
  <button class="topic-btn">
    2. Data Collection
    <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
  </button>
  <div class="topic-content">

    <p>Data collection is the process of gathering relevant data required to solve the defined problem.</p>

    <p>Data can be collected from various sources such as databases, APIs, CSV or Excel files, sensors, and public datasets.</p>

    <p>Data quality is more important than data quantity. Important factors include relevance, completeness, accuracy, and consistency.</p>

    <p>Poor-quality data leads to poor models regardless of which algorithm is used.</p>

    <p>For climate-related problems, data may include temperature records, disaster data, ENSO indices, and urbanization indicators. All datasets must align properly in terms of time and region.</p>

    3. Data Exploration (EDA)
    <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
  </button>
  <div class="topic-content">

    <p>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is used to understand the data before making any modifications.</p>

    <p>EDA helps answer questions such as what the data looks like, whether there are missing values or outliers, how variables are distributed, and whether relationships exist between variables.</p>

    <p>Common EDA activities include viewing data samples, checking data types, calculating summary statistics, and creating visualizations such as histograms and scatter plots.</p>

    <p>EDA prevents blind preprocessing and wrong assumptions, and it guides what preprocessing steps are required next.</p>

  <button class="topic-btn">
    4. Data Preprocessing
    <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
  </button>
  <div class="topic-content">

    <p>Data preprocessing is the process of cleaning and transforming raw data into a format suitable for machine learning models.</p>

    <p>This step often consumes 60–80% of the total project time.</p>

    <p>Real-world data is usually incomplete, noisy, inconsistent, and unstructured. Machine learning algorithms expect numerical, clean, and well-scaled data.</p>

    <p>Common preprocessing tasks include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling and standardization, removing duplicates, and handling outliers.</p>

    <p>This is why data preprocessing is treated as a separate and very important chapter.</p>

    <p>Features are the input variables used by a machine learning model to make predictions.</p>

    <p>Feature selection involves choosing the most relevant features while removing unnecessary or redundant ones. This reduces noise and improves model performance.</p>

    <p>Feature engineering involves creating new meaningful features from existing data.</p>

    <p>For example, combining temperature and humidity to create a heat index, or calculating disaster frequency per decade.</p>

    <p>Good features often improve performance more than complex algorithms.</p>

    <p>Data preprocessing is the process of cleaning, transforming, and preparing raw data so that it can be effectively used by Machine Learning algorithms.</p>

    <p>In real-world projects, raw data is almost never ready for direct use. It may contain missing values, categorical text, inconsistent scales, or noise.</p>

    <p>Machine Learning algorithms work only with numbers and are sensitive to the scale and distribution of data. Therefore, preprocessing is a mandatory step.</p>

    <p><strong>Important reality:</strong> In most Machine Learning projects, 60–80% of the total effort goes into data preprocessing.</p>

    <p>Encoding is the process of converting categorical (text-based) data into numerical form.</p>

    <p>Machine Learning algorithms cannot understand text such as "Low", "Medium", or "High". They only work with numbers.</p>

    <p><strong>After Encoding:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Low → 0</li>
      <li>Medium → 1</li>
      <li>High → 2</li>

    What is Logistic Regression?
    <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
  </button>
  <div class="topic-content">

    <p>Logistic Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for <strong>classification problems</strong>.</p>

    <p>Despite its name, Logistic Regression is <strong>not used for regression</strong>. It is used to predict <strong>categories</strong>, especially <strong>binary outcomes</strong>.</p>

    <p>The main purpose of Logistic Regression is to estimate the <strong>probability</strong> that a given input belongs to a particular class.</p>

    <p>It answers questions like: “What is the probability that this event will happen?”</p>

  </div>
</div>

<!-- ===================== WHY NOT LINEAR ===================== -->
<div class="topic-block">
  <button class="topic-btn">
    Why Linear Regression Cannot Be Used for Classification
    <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
  </button>
  <div class="topic-content">

    <p>Linear Regression produces outputs that can range from negative infinity to positive infinity.</p>

    <p>Classification problems require outputs that represent <strong>class membership</strong>, usually between 0 and 1.</p>

    <p>If we use linear regression for classification, predictions may go below 0 or above 1, which makes no sense for probabilities.</p>

    <p>Therefore, we need a model that restricts outputs to a valid probability range.</p>

</div>

  <button class="topic-btn">
    Probability Interpretation in Logistic Regression
    <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
  </button>
  <div class="topic-content">

    <p>Logistic Regression predicts the probability that an input belongs to a particular class.</p>

    <p>The output is always between <strong>0 and 1</strong>.</p>

    <p>This probability is then converted into a class label using a threshold, usually 0.5.</p>

    <p>For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Probability ≥ 0.5 → Class 1</li>
      <li>Probability &lt; 0.5 → Class 0</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This makes Logistic Regression both interpretable and practical.</p>

    The Sigmoid Function — Heart of Logistic Regression
    <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
  </button>
  <div class="topic-content">

    <p>Logistic Regression uses a special function called the <strong>sigmoid function</strong>.</p>

    <p>The sigmoid function converts any real-valued number into a value between 0 and 1.</p>

    <p><strong>Sigmoid Formula:</strong></p>
    <p><strong>σ(z) = 1 / (1 + e<sup>−z</sup>)</strong></p>

    <p>As z becomes very large, the output approaches 1.</p>
    <p>As z becomes very small, the output approaches 0.</p>

    <p>Logistic Regression first computes a linear combination of inputs:</p>

    <p><strong>z = w₁x₁ + w₂x₂ + ... + b</strong></p>

    <p>This value is then passed through the sigmoid function to produce a probability.</p>

    <p>The model learns the weights and bias that best separate the classes.</p>

  <div class="topic-content">

    <p>The decision boundary is the line (or surface) that separates different classes.</p>

    <p>Logistic Regression creates a boundary where the predicted probability equals the threshold (usually 0.5).</p>

    <p>Points on one side of the boundary are classified as one class, and points on the other side are classified as the other class.</p>

    <p>Logistic Regression uses a loss function called <strong>Log Loss</strong> or <strong>Binary Cross-Entropy</strong>.</p>

    <p>This loss penalizes incorrect predictions more heavily when the model is confident but wrong.</p>

    <p>For example, predicting a probability of 0.99 for a wrong class results in a large loss.</p>

    <p>This encourages the model to be both accurate and well-calibrated.</p>

      <li><strong>Recommendation Systems:</strong> Suggest products or movies based on similar users’ behavior.</li>
      <li><strong>Customer Segmentation:</strong> Group customers based on purchasing patterns or demographics.</li>
      <li><strong>Medical Diagnosis Support:</strong> Identify disease likelihood by comparing patient records with similar past cases.</li>
      <li><strong>Image Recognition:</strong> Classify images by comparing pixel similarity with known images.</li>
      <li><strong>Anomaly Detection:</strong> Detect unusual behavior by checking distance from normal data points.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>KNN is preferred in these cases because decisions are based on <strong>closeness and similarity</strong>, not learned parameters.</p>

<!-- ===================== CONCEPT ===================== -->
<div class="topic-block">
  <button class="topic-btn">
    What is K-Nearest Neighbors? (Conceptual View)
    <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
  </button>
  <div class="topic-content">

    <p>K-Nearest Neighbors is a <strong>supervised learning algorithm</strong> that can be used for both classification and regression.</p>

    <p>Unlike other algorithms, KNN does <strong>not learn a model during training</strong>.</p>

    <p>Instead, it stores the entire dataset and makes predictions only when a new data point appears.</p>

    <p>The prediction is based on the <strong>K closest data points</strong> to the new input.</p>

  <button class="topic-btn">
    Core Intuition — “You Are Like Your Neighbors”
    <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
  </button>
  <div class="topic-content">

    <p>The main idea behind KNN is very intuitive: similar things exist close to each other.</p>

    <p>If most of your nearest neighbors belong to a particular class, you are likely to belong to the same class.</p>

    <p>This is why KNN is called a <strong>distance-based learning algorithm</strong>.</p>

    Distance Metrics — How “Closeness” Is Measured
    <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
  </button>
  <div class="topic-content">

    <p>KNN relies on distance calculations to identify nearest neighbors.</p>

    <p><strong>Most common distance metric:</strong> Euclidean Distance</p>

    <p><strong>Formula:</strong></p>
    <p>√[(x₁ − x₂)² + (y₁ − y₂)²]</p>

    <p>The smaller the distance, the more similar the points.</p>

    Why Scaling Is Mandatory for KNN

  <div class="topic-content">

    <p>KNN depends entirely on distance calculations.</p>

    <p>If features are on different scales, the feature with larger values dominates the distance.</p>

    <p>This can completely distort results.</p>
