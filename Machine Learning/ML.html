<!-- ===================== 1. WHAT IS ML ===================== -->
<div class="topic-block">
<button class="topic-btn">
1. What is Machine Learning?
<i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
</button>
<div class="topic-content">

<p><strong>Machine Learning (ML)</strong> is a technique that enables computers to learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for every rule.</p>

<p>Instead of writing step-by-step instructions such as “if this happens, do that”, we provide the computer with historical data and the correct outcomes. The system then learns relationships from this data and improves its performance over time.</p>

<p>For a machine, learning does not mean thinking or understanding like humans. Learning means identifying mathematical patterns, correlations, and relationships between inputs and outputs.</p>

<p><strong>Human analogy:</strong> Just like a person learns to estimate travel time after making many trips, a machine learns from repeated exposure to data.</p>

<p><strong>Practical example:</strong> In email spam detection, the system learns from thousands of emails and identifies patterns such as keywords, sender behavior, and frequency — without any hard-coded rules.</p>

</div>
</div>

<!-- ===================== 2. TRADITIONAL VS ML ===================== -->
<div class="topic-block">
<button class="topic-btn">
2. Traditional Programming vs Machine Learning
<i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
</button>
<div class="topic-content">

<p>Traditional programming follows a rule-based approach. The programmer explicitly writes logic, and the computer simply executes those instructions.</p>

<p><strong>Traditional programming flow:</strong></p>
<p><code>Rules + Data → Output</code></p>

<p>This approach works well only when rules are simple, fixed, and clearly known.</p>

<p><strong>Machine Learning follows a different approach:</strong></p>
<p><code>Data + Output → Model (Rules)</code></p>

<p>Instead of writing rules, the machine discovers them automatically from data. This makes Machine Learning suitable for complex, real-world problems where rules are unclear or constantly changing.</p>

<p><strong>Key idea:</strong> ML is used when humans cannot clearly explain the rules.</p>

</div>
</div>

<!-- ===================== 3. WHY ML ===================== -->
<div class="topic-block">
<button class="topic-btn">
3. Why Machine Learning?
<i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
</button>
<div class="topic-content">

<p>Machine Learning is required because modern problems involve massive data, complex relationships, and continuously changing conditions.</p>

<p><strong>1. Explosion of data:</strong> Climate sensors, financial systems, medical devices, and online platforms generate enormous amounts of data every day. Humans cannot analyze this manually.</p>

<p><strong>2. Complex relationships:</strong> Real-world outcomes depend on many interacting variables. For example, disasters are influenced by temperature, humidity, ocean cycles, and urbanization.</p>

<p><strong>3. Dynamic systems:</strong> Rules that work today may fail tomorrow. Machine Learning adapts automatically by learning from new data.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> ML is essential because the world is data-rich, complex, and constantly evolving.</p>

<div class="topic-block">
<button class="topic-btn">
4. Applications of Machine Learning
<i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
</button>
<div class="topic-content">

<p><strong>Weather & Climate:</strong> ML helps analyze long-term climate data, detect anomalies, and forecast extreme events.</p>

<p><strong>Healthcare:</strong> ML assists in disease prediction, medical image analysis, and patient risk assessment. It supports doctors but does not replace them.</p>

<p><strong>Finance:</strong> Used for fraud detection, credit scoring, and market analysis. Fraud patterns change frequently, making ML ideal.</p>

<p><strong>Recommendation systems:</strong> Platforms like Netflix and YouTube learn user preferences from behavior rather than fixed rules.</p>

<p><strong>Climate & disaster analysis:</strong> ML can identify extreme climate years, cluster ENSO patterns, and predict disaster likelihood.</p>

</button>
<div class="topic-content">

<p>Machine Learning depends heavily on data quality. Poor data leads to poor predictions.</p>

<p>Bias in data results in biased models.</p>

<p>Overfitting occurs when a model memorizes training data instead of learning patterns.</p>

<p>Some models lack interpretability and act as black boxes.</p>

<p>ML does not possess common sense or reasoning ability.</p>

  <button class="topic-btn">
    Why Do We Classify Machine Learning into Types?
    <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
  </button>
  <div class="topic-content">

    <p>Before learning Machine Learning algorithms, it is extremely important to understand what kind of learning problem we are trying to solve.</p>

    <p>Not all problems are the same. Different problems require different kinds of data, different learning strategies, and different algorithms.</p>

    <p>Machine Learning is therefore classified based on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>How data is provided to the model</li>
      <li>Whether correct answers (labels) are available or not</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This classification helps us decide which approach and algorithms are suitable for a given real-world problem.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<!-- ===================== MAIN TYPES ===================== -->
<div class="topic-block">
  <button class="topic-btn">
    Main Types of Machine Learning
    <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
  </button>
  <div class="topic-content">

    <p>Based on how learning happens, Machine Learning is broadly divided into four main types:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Supervised Learning</li>
      <li>Unsupervised Learning</li>
      <li>Semi-Supervised Learning</li>
      <li>Reinforcement Learning</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Each type addresses a different learning scenario and is used for different categories of problems.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<!-- ===================== SUPERVISED LEARNING ===================== -->
<div class="topic-block">
  <button class="topic-btn">
    1. Supervised Learning
    <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
  </button>
  <div class="topic-content">

    <p>In <strong>Supervised Learning</strong>, the machine learns from <strong>labeled data</strong>.</p>

    <p>This means that for every input data point, the correct output is already known. The model learns by comparing its predicted output with the actual correct output.</p>

    <p>The learning process happens under supervision, similar to how a student learns with the guidance of a teacher.</p>

    <p><strong>Example of labeled data:</strong></p>

    <p>Temperature, Humidity → Rain (Yes / No)</p>

    <p>During training, the model repeatedly adjusts itself to reduce the error between its predictions and the correct answers.</p>

    <p>Supervised learning is the most widely used type of Machine Learning in data science and real-world applications.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<!-- ===================== REGRESSION ===================== -->
<div class="topic-block">
  <button class="topic-btn">
    Supervised Learning — Regression
    <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
  </button>
  <div class="topic-content">

    <p><strong>Regression</strong> is a type of supervised learning used when the output variable is a <strong>continuous numerical value</strong>.</p>

    <p>In regression problems, the goal is to predict a quantity.</p>

    <p><strong>Examples of regression problems:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Predicting temperature</li>
      <li>Predicting rainfall amount</li>
      <li>Predicting house prices</li>
      <li>Predicting CO₂ emission levels</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Regression problems answer questions such as <em>“How much?”</em> or <em>“How many?”</em>.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<div class="topic-block">
  <button class="topic-btn">
    Supervised Learning — Classification
    <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
  </button>
  <div class="topic-content">

    <p><strong>Classification</strong> is a type of supervised learning used when the output is a <strong>category or class</strong>.</p>

    <p>The model learns to assign input data to one of the predefined classes.</p>

    <p><strong>Examples of classification problems:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Flood / No Flood</li>
      <li>El Niño / La Niña / Neutral</li>
      <li>Disease Yes / No</li>
      <li>Spam / Not Spam</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Classification problems answer questions such as <em>“Which category does this belong to?”</em>.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<!-- ===================== UNSUPERVISED LEARNING ===================== -->
<div class="topic-block">
  <button class="topic-btn">
    2. Unsupervised Learning
    <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
  </button>
  <div class="topic-content">

    <p>In <strong>Unsupervised Learning</strong>, the machine learns from <strong>unlabeled data</strong>.</p>

    <p>This means that no correct output values are provided. The model must discover patterns and structure in the data on its own.</p>

    <p>Unsupervised learning is primarily used for <strong>exploration</strong> rather than direct prediction.</p>

    <p>The model tries to find similarities, differences, or unusual patterns in the data.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<!-- ===================== UNSUPERVISED TASKS ===================== -->
<div class="topic-block">
  <button class="topic-btn">
    Unsupervised Learning — Common Tasks
    <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
  </button>
  <div class="topic-content">

    <p><strong>Clustering:</strong> Grouping similar data points together.</p>

    <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Grouping similar climate years</li>
      <li>Clustering disaster-prone regions</li>
      <li>Customer segmentation</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Unsupervised learning is useful when we do not know in advance what patterns exist in the data.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<!-- ===================== SEMI-SUPERVISED ===================== -->
<div class="topic-block">
  <button class="topic-btn">
    3. Semi-Supervised Learning
    <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
  </button>
  <div class="topic-content">

    <p><strong>Semi-Supervised Learning</strong> is a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning.</p>

    <p>In this approach, only a small portion of the data is labeled, while a large portion remains unlabeled.</p>

    <p>This situation is very common in real-world applications because labeling data is often expensive, time-consuming, and requires domain expertise.</p>

    <p>Semi-supervised learning helps improve model performance by making effective use of unlabeled data.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<!-- ===================== REINFORCEMENT LEARNING ===================== -->
<div class="topic-block">
  <button class="topic-btn">
    4. Reinforcement Learning
    <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
  </button>
  <div class="topic-content">

    <p><strong>Reinforcement Learning</strong> is a type of learning based on <strong>trial and error</strong>.</p>

    <p>The model, called an <strong>agent</strong>, interacts with an environment by taking actions.</p>

    <p>For each action, the agent receives feedback in the form of a <strong>reward</strong> or a <strong>penalty</strong>.</p>

    <p>The goal of reinforcement learning is to learn a strategy that maximizes the total reward over time.</p>

    <p>This type of learning is inspired by how humans and animals learn from experience.</p>
