Once upon a time (okay, not too long ago), I was on what you might call a **career break**. Except, let’s be honest, calling it a “break” feels misleading. I wasn’t exactly sipping lattes in peace. I was busy building a family, producing two tiny humans with my better half, and managing the kind of chaos that only toddlers can create — running around, making messes, and keeping everyone on their toes.

But somewhere between diaper duty, bedtime stories, and planning our family business with my husband — where I was always the one throwing in extra suggestions — something whispered in my ear: *“Why can’t you learn something new that could also help with your husband’s business on the technical side?”* Because deep down, problem-solving and finding logic was always my cup of tea.

## The Spark: An Accidental Beginning

It all started while playing with my first child. As she stacked her colorful blocks with a sense of purpose, I thought, *If she can build towers, why can’t I build… a website?* (Yes, motherhood rewires your brain in mysterious ways).

And that thought never left me — if a two-year-old can create something out of tiny colorful blocks, surely I could try creating something out of code.

That’s when I dipped my toes into **HTML and CSS**. I even took a certificate course in **Responsive Web Design** from **freeCodeCamp**. Suddenly, tags, divs, and flexboxes became my new toys. I loved learning how to make things “responsive” — which, let’s face it, is exactly how a mom survives parenting: by being responsive to chaos at all times.

But then my second baby arrived, and let’s just say my coding dreams were replaced by lullabies and burp cloths. My CSS classes were paused… permanently. For a while, I thought my little spark of web design was lost in the great sea of parenting responsibilities.

And just to add to the challenge — when my second baby came, my first was still practically a baby herself at just three years old. Raising two little ones with such a small age gap meant life was a constant juggle of feeding, soothing, and making sure nobody swallowed a Lego piece.

## The Revival: Hello Again, Code

Fast forward to now. I decided it was time. Time to build something of my own. Something that reflects my journey, my learning, my skills, and my goals.

And so, I opened my laptop (while balancing a plate of snacks for the kids and explaining to my husband why the Wi-Fi isn’t “just slow, it’s our destiny”), and began.

And guess what? Those HTML and CSS lessons from years ago came rushing back like an old friend. This time, I had a new ally too: **AI**.

From debugging mysterious CSS quirks to making sense of Jekyll layouts and front-matter files, AI was there, whispering, *“Don’t worry, we’ll fix this together.”* Honestly, AI has been like the third child in my life — except this one actually listens, never throws tantrums, and works 24/7 without snacks.

## The Struggle Was Real (And Funny)

Now, I won’t sugarcoat it. Designing your own website isn’t just typing `<h1>Hello World</h1>` and calling it a day. Oh no.

* Sometimes my images stubbornly refused to appear, hiding in folders like rebellious teenagers.  
* Other times, my navigation menu looked fine on desktop but disappeared faster than my toddler’s patience on mobile.  
* And let’s not forget the countless times I thought, *This is it, I broke the internet*.  

Meanwhile, I was also managing two kids, a household, and of course, my ever-supportive (and occasionally clueless) husband. Picture this: I’d be deep in code, trying to fix a CSS grid, while also cutting fruit into star shapes because apparently, circles are boring now.

But let me also pause here — because while I love poking fun at him, my husband deserves a lot of credit. He has been the constant voice saying, *“You can do this. Don’t stop learning. Go for it.”* He has been more than a partner in parenting; he’s been my sounding board, cheerleader, and a surprisingly good motivational speaker (though sometimes delivered in between asking where the TV remote is). A good father, a supportive husband, and the guy who gave me the courage to step back into learning — he’s part of this website too, in his own way.

## The Milestone: My Personal Website

And yet… I did it.

This website may look simple to seasoned developers, but to me, it’s a **monumental milestone**. It’s proof that learning doesn’t stop because life happens. It’s proof that with a bit of determination (and coffee, lots of coffee), you can carve out space for your dreams, even while juggling kids, kitchen, and commitments.

Now I have a personal corner on the internet where I can showcase:

* My learning journey  
* My skills (both tech and parenting — both equally tough!)  
* My publications and projects  
* And most importantly, my story  

## Why This Matters

Because it’s not “just a website.” It’s a reminder that no matter where you start — whether from an IT background or not, whether you take breaks or detours — progress is always possible.

So here I am, a mom-turned-self-taught-web-designer, proudly saying: *If I can do this between cooking, coding, and calming crying kids, you can too.*

And to my husband — if you’re reading this — yes, I’ll fix the Wi-Fi later. (But only after you find the remote!)

✨ **Moral of the Story:** Don’t wait for the “perfect time.” Start where you are, with what you have (and who you have). Even if your code is messy and your kids are louder than your laptop fan, you’re still building something worth celebrating.
