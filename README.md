# Nisa — Personal Website

This package contains the full static website for Nisa with updated footer and books buttons.

## What changed from the previous package
- Social icons (LinkedIn, GitHub, Medium, YouTube) moved from header to the footer.
- Dark footer with centered copyright:
  `© 2025 Nisa — Built with ❤️ by Nisa`
- Official brand-colored icons in the footer with subtle hover lift.
- Books page and Books section updated:
  - Published books show **Amazon — Coming Soon** (blue button).
  - Upcoming book shows **Upcoming** (grey disabled button).
- Header navigation remains: Home | About | Portfolio | Learn | Blog | Books | Contact

## Files included
- index.html, about.html, portfolio.html, learn.html, blog.html, books.html, contact.html
- style.css
- README.md

## How to use
1. Place your `logo.png` and `profile.png` files in the repository root (same folder as the HTML files).
2. Replace `#` in social links in the footer with your actual profile URLs.
3. Replace `#` in Amazon links with your actual Amazon URLs when available.
4. Upload to GitHub and enable Pages (branch: main or gh-pages).

If you want, I can also:
- Push these files to your GitHub repo (I will provide commands and exact steps).
- Add real social links and Amazon links if you provide them now.
